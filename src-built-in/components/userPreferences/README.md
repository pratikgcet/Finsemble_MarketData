# Sample User Preferences Component for Finsemble
This component is a very simple component that allows users to do a little more with workspaces. In the future we will expand the number of preferences that we expose to users. In a nutshell, this is a menu that should allow users to overwrite whatever config that you think they should be able to overwrite.

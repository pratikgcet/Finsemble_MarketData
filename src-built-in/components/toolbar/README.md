# Finsemble Toolbar

This is a sample toolbar built for the Finsemble framework using our React controls. This is a starting point for developing a custom system toolbar for Finsemble. Our toolbar is made up of several sections, each of which can contain components. The toolbar contents are driven by a config and can be modified dynamically.

## Controls and other components

The toolbar uses the config to [compose](https://reactjs.org/docs/composition-vs-inheritance.html) a toolbar. It uses the following controls, detailed in our React Controls repo.

- [Finsemble Toolbar](https://github.com/ChartIQ/finsemble-react-controls/tree/master/FinsembleToolbar)
- [Finsemble Toolbar Section](https://github.com/ChartIQ/finsemble-react-controls/tree/master/FinsembleToolbarSection)
- [Finsemble Button](https://github.com/ChartIQ/finsemble-react-controls/tree/master/FinsembleButton)
- [Finsemble Toolbar Seperator](https://github.com/ChartIQ/finsemble-react-controls/tree/master/FinsembleToolbarSeprator)
